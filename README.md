# intro_to_costcla_for_p2p

This is my personal project for Fastcampus "Data Science School" 2nd round.
My goal of this project is to introduce "Example-dependent cost-sensitive methods" to Korean P2P lending companies.

Since Credit scoring model is the key competitiveness for p2p companies, I wanted to adopt a new method on the real-world data.
